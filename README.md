# Study of the word _firstborn_ in the biblical text

The study focuses on Paul's use of πρωτότοκος in Colossians 1:15. The intent behind his usage has long been a point of disagreement between those who hold to a trinitarian view of God (Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox) and the theological descendents of Arius (Jehovah's Witnesses). JW's read "firstborn of all creation" as indicating that Christ was the first of God's creations. Trinitarians's understand Paul to be attributing firstborn status over creation to Christ rather than a statement about his origins.
